Remember, if you need to use python just use the full path executable. These are the available examples:
# conda environments:
#
base                     C:\Users\jaime\anaconda3
QWAK                     C:\Users\jaime\anaconda3\envs\QWAK
QWAK2                    C:\Users\jaime\anaconda3\envs\QWAK2

You'll probably want to use QWAK2.
