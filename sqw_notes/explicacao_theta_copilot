You're absolutely right! Let me investigate how the noise is introduced into the quantum walk and verify that the noiseless case is implemented correctly. Let me first find the implementation that handles the noise. Now let me find the specific implementation that handles the noise generation: Now let me look at how the evolution operator is constructed with noise: Now I need to see how the noiseless case (0,0) is handled. Let me check if there's any special case handling: I see the issue! For the (0,0) case, `deviation_range` is a tuple `(0, 0)`, so `dev_min = 0` and `dev_max = 0`. When calling `random.uniform(0, 0)`, it should always return exactly 0, making it truly noiseless.

However, there might be an issue with how the theta value is being used in the current experiments. The current experiments use `theta = math.pi` but the diagnostic shows we used `theta = 3.141593`. Let me create a barebones test to verify this: 

Made changes.

**Bingo!** I found the issue! The problem is with the choice of `theta = π`.

Look at the results:

1. **theta = π/3**: Noiseless case has std_dev ≈ 25 (normal), total variance across samples ≈ 2.79e-17 (tiny)
2. **theta = π**: Noiseless case has std_dev ≈ 5.4e-15 (extremely small!), total variance across samples = 0
3. **theta = π/2**: Noiseless case has std_dev = 0 (exactly zero!)
4. **theta = π/4**: Noiseless case has std_dev ≈ 3.9 (normal), total variance across samples ≈ 1.4e-17 (tiny)

**The problem**: `theta = π` is a special case where the evolution operator becomes trivial!

Remember the staggered quantum walk evolution: `U = exp(i*θ*H_β) * exp(i*θ*H_α)`

When `θ = π`, we have:
- `exp(i*π*H) = cos(π)I + i*sin(π)H = -I + 0*H = -I`
- So `U = (-I) * (-I) = I` (identity!)

This means with `theta = π`, the quantum walk doesn't evolve at all - it stays exactly in the initial state! That's why the standard deviation is essentially zero (just numerical precision errors).

The current experiments are using `theta = math.pi`, which makes the noiseless case trivial. We should be using `theta = math.pi/3` as intended.

Let me check what theta value is actually being used in the current experiments: I can see that:

1. **Data generation scripts** use `theta = math.pi/3` (commented) and `theta = math.pi` (active)
2. **Plot script** uses `theta = math.pi` 
3. **Old scripts** use `theta = math.pi/3`

This confirms that the current data was generated with `theta = math.pi`, which makes the noiseless case degenerate.

**The fix**: We need to change the theta value back to `math.pi/3` in all the generation scripts. Let me fix this: The issue is clear now. The data was generated and is being plotted with `theta = π`, which makes the quantum walk degenerate (evolution operator becomes identity). 

**Summary of the problem:**
1. With `theta = π`, the staggered quantum walk evolution operator `U = exp(i*π*H_β) * exp(i*π*H_α) = (-I) * (-I) = I`
2. This means the quantum walk doesn't evolve at all - it stays in the initial state
3. The noiseless case shows extremely small standard deviations (≈1e-12) which are just numerical precision errors
4. The noisy cases still show variation because the noise deviates the theta values away from exactly π

**The fix:** Change back to `theta = π/3` in all scripts to get meaningful quantum walk evolution.

Would you like me to fix the theta values in all the scripts, or would you prefer to regenerate the data with the correct theta value?
