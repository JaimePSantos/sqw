# Memory Management Improvements Summary

## Changes Made to static_cluster_logged_mp.py

### 1. Mean Probability Distribution Calculation (`compute_mean_probability_for_dev`)

**Improvements:**
- **Immediate state cleanup**: Clear quantum states from memory immediately after converting to probability distributions
- **Aggressive garbage collection**: Force `gc.collect()` after clearing large data structures
- **Memory monitoring**: Log memory usage every 100 steps and after major operations
- **Progressive cleanup**: Clear variables as soon as they're no longer needed
- **Final process cleanup**: Force memory cleanup at the end of each worker process

**Specific Changes:**
```python
# Before: Basic cleanup
sample_states[i] = None
del prob_distributions

# After: Aggressive cleanup
sample_states[i] = None
del state
del sample_states
gc.collect()
del prob_distributions
gc.collect()
del mean_prob_dist
gc.collect()
```

### 2. Standard Deviation Calculation (`create_or_load_std_data`)

**Improvements:**
- **Per-deviation cleanup**: Clear mean probability distributions for each deviation after processing
- **Memory monitoring**: Track memory usage before/after each std calculation
- **Aggressive garbage collection**: Multiple rounds of cleanup
- **Progressive nullification**: Set processed mean_results entries to None to free memory

**Specific Changes:**
```python
# Clear mean probability distributions for this deviation immediately
if i < len(mean_results):
    mean_results[i] = None
del dev_mean_prob_dists
gc.collect()
```

### 3. Main Analysis Phase

**Improvements:**
- **Load monitoring**: Track memory usage when loading mean probability distributions
- **Post-processing cleanup**: Clear all mean_results after standard deviation calculation
- **Comprehensive logging**: Monitor memory at all major phases

### 4. New Helper Functions

**Added:**
- `force_memory_cleanup()`: Aggressive cleanup with multiple GC rounds
- Enhanced memory monitoring in existing functions

## Expected Benefits

1. **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Each step/deviation releases memory immediately
2. **Better Scalability**: Can handle larger N values without memory exhaustion  
3. **Monitoring**: Clear visibility into memory usage patterns
4. **Robustness**: Less likely to hit memory limits on cluster systems

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify improvements:
- `test_memory_management.py`: Tests memory usage during analysis phase
- Memory monitoring throughout the process shows usage patterns

## Usage Notes

- Memory cleanup is automatic - no user configuration needed
- Memory usage is logged to both console and log files
- Aggressive cleanup may slightly increase computation time but significantly reduces memory usage
- Particularly beneficial for large N values (>10,000) and many time steps
