# Unified Folder Structure Changes

## Summary
Successfully implemented a unified folder structure that eliminates the separation between noise and no-noise experiments. Now all experiments use the same folder naming pattern, with noise values always included in the path (including 0 for no-noise cases).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Modified `get_experiment_dir()` function in `smart_loading_static.py`
- **Before**: Separate folder names based on `has_noise` (e.g., `static_noise` vs `static_noise_nonoise`)
- **After**: Unified folder structure where noise value is always included in path

**New Structure:**
```
# All noise types now use unified naming:
- angle: tesselation_func_angle/dev_X.XXX/N_Y
- tesselation_order: tesselation_func_tesselation_order/shift_prob_X.XXX/N_Y  
- static_noise: tesselation_func_static_noise/theta_X.XXXXXX/dev_X.XXX/N_Y

# Examples:
- No noise (dev=0): dummy_tesselation_func_static_noise/theta_1.570796/dev_0.000/N_106
- With noise (dev=0.01): dummy_tesselation_func_static_noise/theta_1.570796/dev_0.010/N_106
```

**Old Structure:**
```
- No noise: dummy_tesselation_func_static_noise_nonoise/theta_1.570796/N_106
- With noise: dummy_tesselation_func_static_noise/theta_1.570796/dev_0.010/N_106
```

### 2. Updated `find_experiment_dir_flexible()` function
- Added backward compatibility support
- Tries new unified structure first, then falls back to old separated structure
- Returns format type for debugging: 'unified', 'legacy', 'legacy_nonoise'

### 3. Updated all directory-related functions
Modified these functions to work with unified structure:
- `run_and_save_experiment_generic()`
- `load_experiment_results_generic()`
- `run_and_save_experiment_samples_tesselation()`
- `run_and_save_experiment_samples()`
- `create_mean_probability_distributions()`
- `load_mean_probability_distributions()`
- `check_mean_probability_distributions_exist()`
- `smart_load_or_create_experiment()`

### 4. Updated main script `static_local_logged_mp.py`
- Modified `noise_params` handling to always include the deviation value
- Removed conditional logic that set `noise_params = [dev] if has_noise else [0]`
- Now uses `noise_params = [dev]` consistently

## Benefits of Unified Structure

1. **Simplified Logic**: No need to determine `has_noise` for path creation
2. **Consistent Naming**: All experiments follow the same folder naming pattern
3. **Easier Navigation**: All noise values (including 0) are clearly identified in folder names
4. **Better Organization**: No artificial separation between noise and no-noise cases
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Old experiments can still be found and loaded

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains full backward compatibility:
- `find_experiment_dir_flexible()` tries unified structure first
- If not found, searches for old separated structure
- Returns format type so users know which structure was found
- New experiments automatically use unified structure

## Testing Performed

1. **Structure Verification**: Confirmed unified paths are generated correctly
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Verified old structure detection works
3. **Main Script Integration**: Tested main script runs with unified structure
4. **Path Examples**: 
   - Dev 0: `test_experiments\dummy_tesselation_func_static_noise\theta_1.570796\dev_0.000\N_106`
   - Dev 0.01: `test_experiments\dummy_tesselation_func_static_noise\theta_1.570796\dev_0.010\N_106`

## Migration Notes

- **Automatic**: New experiments automatically use unified structure
- **No Data Loss**: Existing experiments remain accessible via backward compatibility
- **No Manual Migration Required**: Old data continues to work seamlessly
- **Gradual Transition**: System will naturally migrate to unified structure as new experiments are run

## Files Modified

1. `smart_loading_static.py` - Core directory management functions
2. `static_local_logged_mp.py` - Main script parameter handling

The changes provide a cleaner, more consistent folder structure while maintaining full compatibility with existing data.
