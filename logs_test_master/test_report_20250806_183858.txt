RECOMMENDATIONS:
  [WARN] Some tests failed - review implementation
  [WARN] Crash detection may need improvement
  [WARN] Deadman switch may need verification

NEXT STEPS FOR CLUSTER DEPLOYMENT:
  1. Deploy enhanced logging to cluster environment
  2. Monitor logs during actual quantum walk experiments
  3. Use diagnostic tools to identify termination causes
  4. Implement checkpointing based on signal patterns
