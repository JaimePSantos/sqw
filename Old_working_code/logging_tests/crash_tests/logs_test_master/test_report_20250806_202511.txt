  Deadman switch triggers: 0

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
  Total tests executed: 6
  Total tests passed: 1
  Overall success rate: 16.7%
  Crash detection capability: FAIL
  Deadman switch functionality: FAIL

CATEGORY-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
  [WARN] Basic tests: 2 failures need review
  [WARN] Crash tests: 0 failures need review
  [WARN] Validation tests: 3 failures need review

OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS:
  [WARN] Some tests failed - review implementation
  [WARN] Crash detection may need improvement
  [WARN] Deadman switch may need verification

NEXT STEPS FOR CLUSTER DEPLOYMENT:
  1. Deploy enhanced logging to cluster environment
  2. Monitor logs during actual quantum walk experiments
  3. Use diagnostic tools to identify termination causes
  4. Implement checkpointing based on signal patterns
