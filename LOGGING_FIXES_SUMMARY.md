# Logging Fixes Summary

## Problem Identified
Based on the logs analysis, the mean probability computation was generating excessive logging:

### Issues Found:
1. **Every step was being logged** during processing (lines like "Step 4001/5000 processing...")
2. **Every processed step was being logged** (lines like "Step 4001/5000 processed (valid samples: 5)")
3. **Every missing sample was being logged** 
4. This resulted in **over 1000 log lines per process** instead of reasonable progress updates

### Root Cause:
The logging condition was:
```python
if step_idx % 100 == 0 or current_time - last_log_time >= 60:  # Every 100 steps OR 1 minute
```

The "OR 1 minute" condition caused logging for almost every step because:
- Each step takes time to process
- After 1 minute, every subsequent step would trigger logging
- This defeated the purpose of limiting to every 100 steps

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Progress Logging Logic**
**Before:**
```python
if step_idx % 100 == 0 or current_time - last_log_time >= 60:
    logger.info(f"Step {step_idx+1}/{steps} processing...")
    if current_time - last_log_time >= 300:
        log_system_resources(logger, "[WORKER]")
        last_log_time = current_time
```

**After:**
```python
should_log_progress = (step_idx % 100 == 0)
should_log_resources = (current_time - last_log_time >= 300)  # Every 5 minutes

if should_log_progress:
    logger.info(f"Step {step_idx+1}/{steps} processing...")

if should_log_resources:
    log_system_resources(logger, "[WORKER]")
    last_log_time = current_time
```

### 2. **Limited Missing Sample Warnings**
**Before:**
```python
else:
    logger.warning(f"No valid samples found for step {step_idx}")  # Every missing step
```

**After:**
```python
else:
    if step_idx % 100 == 0:  # Only every 100 steps
        logger.warning(f"No valid samples found for step {step_idx+1}")
```

### 3. **Kept Reasonable Completion Logging**
- Completion logging already had correct logic (every 100 steps or final step)
- Fixed step numbering to be consistent (step_idx+1)

## Expected Log Reduction

### Before:
- ~5000 "processing" logs per process (one per step when processing new steps)
- ~5000 "processed" logs per process  
- Multiple warnings per process
- **Total: ~10,000+ log lines per process**

### After:
- ~50 "processing" logs per process (every 100 steps)
- ~50 "processed" logs per process (every 100 steps + final)
- Limited warnings (every 100 steps)
- Resource monitoring every 5 minutes
- **Total: ~100-150 log lines per process**

## Benefits

1. **98% reduction in log volume** - from ~10,000 to ~150 lines per process
2. **Cleaner progress tracking** - clear milestones every 100 steps
3. **Better performance** - less I/O overhead from excessive logging
4. **Easier debugging** - logs are now readable and focused on important events
5. **Cluster-friendly** - won't fill up disk space with massive log files

## Verification

Both `static_cluster_logged_mp.py` and `static_local_logged_mp.py` have been updated with these fixes and compile without syntax errors.

The logging will now show:
- Progress every 100 steps
- Resource monitoring every 5 minutes  
- Completion status for major milestones
- Warnings only when needed (not spamming)

This should make the cluster runs much more manageable and easier to monitor.
